# mlproject

This is a practice project that was created with the help of a follow along Tutorial by [Krish Naik](https://github.com/krishnaik06/mlproject.git) 
I will be adding my own changes in this project, mainly in the front-end and hyperparameter tuning process.

This project is deployed in Heroku.
